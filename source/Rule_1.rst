RULE 1 - Chartering Process for Republican Clubs
==================================================

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. *Restrictions on Use of the Name, Abbreviations, and Symbols of the Republican Party*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) No person or group of persons may use the name, abbreviations, or symbols of
the Republican Party in connection with any club, group, association, or organization of any
kind unless approval and permission have been given by the Republican Party of Florida in the
form of a written charter issued under this Rule. This Rule does not apply to county Republican
Executive Committees, to Republican Affiliated Party Committees, to organizations that are
chartered by the Republican National Committee, or to organizations using the name,
abbreviations, or symbols of the Republican Party that have been in existence and organized on
a statewide basis for a period of ten years.

(2) No member of the State Executive Committee or of a County Executive
Committee may be a member or officer of any organization that has been deemed by the RPOF
Chairman to be in violation of the restrictions on use of the name, abbreviations, and symbols
of the Republican Party as provided for in this Rule or section `103.081, Florida Statutes`_.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B. *Conditional Chartering Process for New Republican Clubs*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any non-chartered club, group, association, or organization seeking a charter under this
Rule may submit a conditional charter application including the written approval of a majority
of the following Republican Party officials from the county or counties in which it is organized
(including at least one such official in each county in which it is organized): County Chairman,
State Committeeman, State Committeewoman. Applicants organized on a statewide basis need
not obtain the written approval of the Republican Party officials in each county, but will instead
require the approval of the Executive Board of the Republican Party of Florida. Upon the
approval of the Chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, a conditional charter will be issued
to the applicant. Each conditional charter expires on March 31 of the calendar year after the
year in which it is issued. A conditional charter may be revoked at any time, without notice, and
for any reason in the sole discretion of the Chairman of the Republican Party of Florida. An
organization that has received a conditional charter may apply for a general charter through the
general charter renewal process provided in this Rule. A conditional charter may be renewed
for an additional one-year period or converted to a general charter in the sole discretion of the
Chairman of the Republican Party of Florida in consultation with the applicable County
Republican Executive Committee officials.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C. *Renewal and Revocation of General Charters for Existing Republican Clubs*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) All general charters issued by the Republican Party of Florida expire on
March 31 of each odd-numbered year unless renewed as provided in this Rule. On or before
February 1 in each odd-numbered year, the Republican Party of Florida will send charter
renewal information, requirements, and instructions to each chartered club, group,
association, or organization with a copy to the applicable Republican State Executive
Committee Members. On or before March 15, any club wishing to renew its charter must
submit a general charter renewal application including the written approval of a majority of
the following Republican Party officials from the county or counties in which it is organized
(including at least one such official in each county in which it is organized): County Chairman,
State Committeeman, State Committeewoman. Upon the approval of the Chairman of the
Republican Party of Florida, a new general charter will be issued to the applicant.

(2) Any club, group, association, or organization that has been chartered and in
good standing for a period of ten continuous years is exempt from the renewal application
process provided in subsection (C)(1) and may receive an expedited renewal of its charter
upon the approval of the Chairman of the Republican Party of Florida and one State Executive
Committee member from each county in which it is so organized.

(3) The Chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, in consultation with the
applicable County Republican Executive Committee officials, may revoke any general charter
for good cause shown. Failure to comply with the requirements of this Rule constitutes good
cause for revocation of a general charter.

(4) The decision to revoke or not to renew a general charter may be appealed to
the Republican Party of Florida as prescribed in this Rule. Any chartered club, group,
association, or organization wishing to appeal a revocation or non-renewal of its general
charter must submit a Notice identifying in detail the basis of its appeal within 90 days after it
receives the decision to revoke or not to renew the charter. The Grievance Committee shall
review all Notices of Appeal and may call for a response from any State Executive Committee
members who supported the revocation of non-renewal of the general charter.

After considering the appeal, the Grievance Committee shall either: a) affirm the
revocation or non-renewal (in which case there shall be no further appeal); or b) recommend to
the Executive Board of the Republican Party that the revocation or non-renewal be overturned.
After considering the Grievance Committeeâ€™s recommendation and the merits of the appeal,
the Executive Board of the Republican Party of Florida may restore and renew a general charter
or revert the general charter to a conditional charter. The decision of the Executive Board is
final and is not subject to further appeal in any forum.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D. *Restrictions on Activities by Chartered Republican Clubs*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chartered Republican clubs must conduct their affairs in compliance with applicable
state and federal election and campaign finance laws. No chartered club, group, association, or
organization may adopt by-laws that are inconsistent with state or federal law, the Constitution
or Party Rules of Procedure of the Republican State Executive Committee, or the Republican
Party of Florida County Model Constitution. No chartered club, group, association, or
organization may participate in intra-party differences, nor may it, in its official capacity as a
chartered organization support the nomination of one Republican candidate over another
unless the Republican Party has voted to endorse that candidate under `Rule 8`_. No chartered
club, group, association, or organization may invite a non-Republican to be a guest speaker at
an official meeting or function without the approval of the Chairman of the County Republican
Executive Committee.
