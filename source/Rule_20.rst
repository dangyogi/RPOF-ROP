RULE 20 - Chairman’s Paid Expenses
=====================================================

A. The RPOF Chairman shall be reimbursed for all party-related expenses incurred,
   including transportation, mileage, lodging, and meals. The Chairman’s request for
   reimbursement shall be submitted to the Audit Committee within 30 days of the end of the
   quarter the expenses were incurred, unless an extension is granted by the Audit Committee,
   and shall include complete documentation of all expenses submitted for reimbursement.
   Before any expense is reimbursed to the RPOF Chairman, the Audit Committee must make a
   timely determination of the appropriateness of the reimbursement request. If the Audit
   Committee declines to approve the reimbursement request, the RPOF Chairman may submit
   the matter to the RPOF Executive Board for final resolution.

B. The definition of “party-related expenses” shall be based on the rules of the Internal
   Revenue Service regarding business-related expenses eligible for deduction.
