the party’s legitimate objectives through reasonable and non-discriminatory restrictions on
ballot access.

writing. A copy of the oath or affirmation shall be made available to the candidate upon request

C. *Methods of Qualifying for Presidential Preference Primary Ballot*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each Republican presidential candidate seeking to appear on the presidential preference
primary ballot shall:

(1) *Florida Freedom Summit Option*—- In an election without an incumbent
    Republican President seeking to appear on the presidential preference primary ballot, any
    candidate invited to attend the Republican Party of Florida’s Florida Freedom Summit, may
    qualify through personal appearance at the Florida Freedom Summit to execute and file the
    `Candidate Oath`_ prescribed by this rule, which shall be witnessed by the Chairman of the
    Republican Party of Florida or the Chairman’s designee, and by paying a candidate qualifying
    fee made payable to the Republican Party of Florida in the amount of $25,000; :underline:`or`

(2) *Qualifying Fee Option*—- No later than 5 p.m. on November 22, qualify by filing
    with the Republican Party of Florida the `Candidate Oath`_ prescribed by this rule and a
    candidate qualifying fee made payable to the Republican Party of Florida in the amount of
    $100,000; :underline:`or`

(3) *Petition Option*-— No later than 5 p.m. on November 22, qualify by filing with the
    Republican Party of Florida the `Candidate Oath`_ prescribed by this rule and RPOF Candidate
    Petitions on the RPOF prescribed Petition Form, collected by volunteers, containing the
    original, wet-ink signatures and printed names of at least 2,000 registered Republican voters
    from each of Florida’s 28 Congressional Districts. The Republican Party of Florida will: 1) check
    the Petition Forms to verify the signatories’ status as registered Republican voters in the stated
    Congressional Districts; and 2) determine whether the required number of signatures has been
    obtained. A signature shall not be verified as valid and counted toward the required number of
    signatures unless the signature is on the proper RPOF prescribed Petition Form and the
    Petition Form contains all of the following information:

    1) The voter’s printed and legible name;
    2) The voter’s address (including city and county);
    3) The voter’s congressional district number;
    4) The voter’s date of birth or voter registration number;
    5) The voter’s original, wet-ink signature; and
    6) The date the voter signed the Petition Form, as recorded by the voter; :underline:`or`

(4) *Presidential Option*-— No later than 5 p.m. on November 22, an incumbent
    Republican President of the United States may qualify by submitting a letter to the Chairman
    of the Republican Party of Florida indicating a desire to have their name submitted for
    placement on the presidential preference primary ballot. A letter submitted pursuant to this
    Option fulfills the requirement for the `Candidate Oath`_ prescribed by this rule.

    No other proxy or alternative qualifying method for the presidential preference primary
    shall be available. Any qualifying fees collected under this Rule will be devoted entirely to
    grassroots engagement activities in support of the Republican Party’s candidates in the
    General Election. The Republican Party of Florida retains the sole and exclusive authority to
    adjudicate compliance with all requirements of this party rule.
