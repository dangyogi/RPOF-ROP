RULE 5 - Election of Precinct Committeemen and Women
=====================================================

A.

  (1) Each precinct within each county shall, except as otherwise provided in this
      rule, the party constitution, or state law, elect one man, who is a registered Republican, and
      one woman, who is a registered Republican, to serve as Precinct Committeeman and Precinct
      Committeewoman. However, any precinct with a total registration equal to or greater than
      1000 registered voters shall be entitled to an additional Precinct Committeeman and Precinct
      Committeewoman for every increment of 1000 registered voters in the precinct, who shall
      serve for the full term of the office regardless of change in precinct population.

  (2) The number of registered voters shall be determined at or just prior to the
      commencement of the qualifying period for such office as shown by the most recent voter
      registration records of the Supervisor of Elections in such County. At any time thereafter,
      should the number of registered voters increase so as to exceed 1000 voters, the County
      Executive Committee shall elect one additional Precinct Committeeman and Precinct
      Committeewoman in accordance with the procedures set forth below for the filling of vacancies
      and who shall serve until the commencement of the term of his or her successor, if any.

B. In counties divided into 40 or more precincts, the State Executive Committee may adopt
   a district unit of representation for such county Executive Committees. Upon adoption of a
   district unit of representation, the State Executive Committee shall request the supervisor of
   elections of that county, with approval of the Board of County Commissioners, to provide for an
   appropriate number of election districts as nearly equal in number of registered voters as
   possible. Where the district unit of representation has been adopted, district representatives
   shall be elected in the same manner as Precinct Committeemen and Committeewomen, and
   shall serve in place of precinct men and women.

C. The Precinct Committeemen and women or the district men and women elected in
   accordance with this rule shall constitute the County Executive Committee. Pursuant to the
   party constitution, and Florida Statutes, the State Committeeman and State Committeewoman,
   and all members of the Florida legislature who are residents of the county and members of the
   Republican Party, shall be voting members of the County Executive Committee. County
   Executive Committees shall not extend voting membership status to any other individuals. Each
   member of the committee shall be entitled to one vote.

D. Pursuant to `Florida Statutes 103.091(5)`_, in the event no county committeeman or
   committeewoman is elected or a vacancy occurs from any other cause in the County Executive
   Committee, the vacancy shall be filled by a majority vote of those present at a regular meeting
   at which a quorum is present. Such vacancy shall be filled by a qualified member of the political
   party residing in the precinct or district where the vacancy occurred and for the unexpired
   portion of the term and shall not be deemed a member until the name has been duly recorded
   with the Supervisor of Elections by the secretary of the County Executive Committee.

   (1) Each County Executive Committee must abide by the following procedures when filling a vacancy:

       (a) A prospective member must have the ability to complete and submit
           an initial membership application to fill the vacancy at the first
           County Executive Committee meeting they attend. The initial
           application shall consist of the RPOF `Loyalty Oath`_ and a `Candidate
           Oath`_.

       (b) Following the submission of the initial membership application and
           prior to the next County Executive Committee meeting, the County
           Secretary must verify the eligibility of the prospective member
           including that he or she is currently a registered Republican voter in
           the State of Florida and has been a registered Republican for the
           previous 365 days, whether in Florida or another state, and whether
           the prospective member resides in a precinct or district where a
           vacancy exists. Ineligible prospective members may not be voted on
           by the County Executive Committee. A County Secretary’s inability to
           verify a prospective member’s eligibility is not a valid basis for
           withholding the prospective member from being voted upon by the
           County Executive Committee if the prospective member completes an
           RPOF `Loyalty Oath`_ and a `Candidate Oath`_ swearing that they meet the
           qualifications for membership.

       (c) Following the submission of an eligible prospective member’s initial
           membership application, the County Executive Committee must hold
           a vote at the next County Executive Committee meeting that the
           eligible prospective member attends, but if the eligible prospective
           member is not in attendance for three meetings following the
           submission of their initial membership application, then their
           application expires and they must restart the process.

       (d) A County Executive Committee is prohibited from imposing additional
           requirements for membership beyond those requirements contained
           in Florida law, the RPOF Constitution, the RPOF Rules, and the RPOF
           County Model Constitution including any attendance requirements at
           REC meetings or new member orientations or similar training or
           programs. The County Executive Committee may provide optional
           new member training and orientation.

       (e) Following an affirmative vote on a prospective member by the County
           Executive Committee, the notarized `Candidate Oath`_ must be
           promptly submitted to the County Secretary or, alternatively,
           executed at the County Executive Committee meeting. The County
           Secretary must promptly provide the `Loyalty Oath`_ and current
           membership roster to the Republican Party of Florida within 30 days
           of the vote and the `Candidate Oath`_ to the Supervisor of Elections.

E. In accordance with `Section 103.091, Florida Statutes`_, Precinct Committeemen and
   Precinct Committeewomen shall be elected for four-year terms which shall commence on the
   first day of the month following each general election (December 1). Within thirty days of the
   primary election, Precinct Committeemen and Precinct Committeewomen shall sign and file a
   `loyalty oath`_ as prescribed in `Rule 9`_. Failure to file a completed `loyalty oath`_ is cause for
   immediate removal from office.

F. Candidates for Precinct Committeemen and Precinct Committeewomen shall qualify for
   office in accordance with `Section 103.091, Florida Statutes`_.

G. The outgoing chairman of each County Executive Committee shall hold an organizational
   meeting of all newly elected precinct committee members and for the purpose of electing
   officers and said meeting shall take place within 30 days of the date the new members take
   office.
