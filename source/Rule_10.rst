The Republican presidential candidate receiving the highest number of statewide votes
at the Florida Presidential Preference Primary shall be awarded all delegates and alternate
delegates to the Republican National Convention. The delegates and alternate delegates shall
be elected as prescribed by `Rule 10(D)`_. The Chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, or his
or her designee, shall be bound to count and cast all delegate votes for that presidential

    alternate delegates, each candidate for election as a delegate or alternate delegate shall
    certify that he or she is duly qualified to serve under this Rule by filing a qualifying oath
    or affirmation in a form approved by the General Counsel to the Republican Party of Florida.
