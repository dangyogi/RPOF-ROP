       candidate:*

           (1) *Seeking election against the Republican Party’s
               nominee in a partisan unitary, general, or special election that
               includes a Republican nominee; or*

           (2) *Who is not a registered Republican and is seeking
               election against a registered Republican in a non-partisan
               election, except that this provision does not apply to judicial races

       *I further swear or affirm that, in my capacity as a Republican
       Executive Committee member I will not support, in a contested
       Republican primary election, the nomination of one Republican
       candidate over another, or in a nonpartisan election, the election
       of one registered Republican over another, unless the Executive

       with RPOF* `Rule 8`_. *This provision does not preclude me from
       supporting in any manner my personal Republican candidate of
       choice in a contested Republican primary election or my personal
       registered Republican candidate of choice in a nonpartisan
       election, provided I do not express such support with public
       reference to my title or office within the Republican Party of
       Florida.*
