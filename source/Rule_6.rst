RULE 6 - Officers of County Committees; Role and Responsibilities
=====================================================================

A. All officers of a County Executive Committee including but not limited to, the County
   Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Secretary and Treasurer shall be members of such committee and
   this rule shall be included as a provision in the county committee’s constitution and/or bylaws.
   All county party executive committee officers shall be elected for a two-year term and may hold
   only one office in the County Executive Committee. Alternate county executive committee
   members are not eligible to serve as elected officers of the County Executive Committee, unless
   this rule is waived by the Executive Board of RPOF. The creation of additional voting positions
   on the County Executive Board besides County Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Secretary, Treasurer,
   State Committeeman, and State Committeewoman shall occur only via the amendment process
   outlined in the County Model Constitution.

B. Florida Statutes and the Rules of the Republican Party of Florida require that certain
   items be filed with the Republican Party of Florida by the County Executive Committee. In the
   event that such filings are not timely made, the Chairman of the Republican Party of Florida
   shall notify the chairman of the County Executive Committee by registered mail of the
   delinquency. The chairman shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of such notification to file
   the appropriate materials. If the filing is not completed within thirty (30) days, the Chairman of
   the Republican Party of Florida may remove from office the chairman of the County Executive
   Committee, and that office will devolve to the person in succession as defined by the
   constitution and/or by-laws of the County Executive Committee. Such person shall, within thirty
   (30) days, call a meeting for purposes of electing a new Chairman in accordance with the
   election procedures set forth in the constitution and/or bylaws of the County Executive
   Committee. If the acting chairman fails to timely call such an election, the Chairman of the
   Republican Party of Florida may remove the acting Chairman from office. That office will then
   devolve to the next person in succession as defined by the constitution and/or bylaws of the
   County Executive Committee.

C. Each County Executive Committee shall meet at least six (6) times during the calendar
   year, one meeting within each quarter with at least twenty-eight days between each meeting.
   The meeting shall be called by the Chairman, with notice of the meeting to be sent provided to
   each member of the executive committee at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting. This shall
   specifically be the duty of the County Chairman, and in the event that the County Chairman
   does not call such meetings when due, the State Chairman may remove the County Chairman
   from office. In such event, the office of county chairman shall devolve to the next person in
   succession as defined by the constitution and/or bylaws of the County Executive Committee. If
   the acting Chairman fails to timely call such an election, the Chairman of the Republican Party
   of Florida may remove the acting chairman from office. The office will then devolve to the next
   person in succession as defined by the constitution and/or bylaws of the County Executive
   Committee.
