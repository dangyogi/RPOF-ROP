RULE 8 - Endorsements
=====================================================

A. The State Executive Committee may endorse, certify, screen, or recommend candidates
   in contested Republican primaries only upon unanimous approval of the Executive Board and
   the approval of 60% of the State Executive Committee at a meeting called for that purpose and
   at which a quorum is present.

B. County Executive Committee may endorse, certify, screen, or recommend a Republican
   candidate in a contested Republican primary, or a registered Republican in a nonpartisan
   election (including judicial races where it is legally permissible), or a local Unitary
   Special/General Election, by either of the two following methods: (1) Upon the affirmative vote
   of not less than 60% of the County Executive Committee present and voting at a duly called
   meeting complying with notice requirements set forth below, provided that the number voting
   to endorse represents a majority of the full committee, or (2) upon the affirmative vote of not
   less than two-thirds (2/3) of those present and voting at such meeting, provided that a quorum
   is present at the time the vote is taken. Each announced candidate shall be likewise notified
   that a vote on endorsement is to be taken and that he or she will be allowed to speak at such
   meeting in support of or opposition to any proposed endorsement, certification, or
   recommendation for an office for which he or she is a candidate.

C. There shall be no less than ten days written notice to each member of the Executive
   Committee of any meeting at which the vote is to be taken. The written notice shall inform
   each member of the time, date, place of meeting, and that a vote will be taken to endorse,
   certify, screen or otherwise recommend one or more Republican candidates for nomination for
   election. A copy of the notice of the meeting shall be mailed by the County Chairman or other
   appropriate officer to: Republican Party of Florida, P.O. Box 311, Tallahassee, Florida, 32302.

D. A County Republican Executive Committee may not endorse, certify, screen, or
   recommend a candidate in a contested election for a publicly elected position on a Republican
   Executive Committee. This provision does not preclude any Republican Executive Committee
   member from supporting in any manner his or her personal candidate of choice in a contested
   election for a publicly elected position on a Republican Executive Committee, provided he or
   she does not express that support with public reference to his or her title or office within the
   Republican Party of Florida.
