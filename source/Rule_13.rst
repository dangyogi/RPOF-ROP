RULE 13 – Indemnification
=====================================================

A. The State Committee of the Republican Party of Florida (the “committee”) may, upon
   the affirmative vote of the majority of the Executive Board, to the extent legally permissible,
   indemnify each person serving or who has served as a member of the Committee or of the
   Executive Board against all liabilities and expenses, including amounts paid in satisfaction of
   judgments, in compromise or as fines and penalties, and counsel fees reasonably incurred by
   him or her, in connection with the defense or disposition of any action, suit, or other
   proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, in which he or she may be
   involved or with which he or she may be threatened, while in office or thereafter, by reason of
   his or her being or having been such a member or by reason of his or her serving or having
   served the Committee in any capacity referred to in the next paragraph.

B. “County Executive Committees Each County Executive Committee of the Republican
   Party of Florida may provide indemnification to the same extent and on the same terms as is
   provided by the State Executive Committee of the Republican Party of Florida to its members,
   pursuant to paragraph A above.”

C. That indemnification of other persons serving or who have served as officers,
   employees, or other agents of the Committee, or, at its request, as members, directors,
   trustees, officers, employees, fiduciaries, or other agents of a corporation, trust, or other
   organization in which the Committee has an interest may be provided by the Committee
   whenever and to the extent authorized by a disinterested majority of the members of the
   Executive Board. Any such indemnification may include payment of the Committee of expenses
   incurred in defending any such action, suit, or other proceeding in advance of the final
   disposition thereof, upon receipt of an undertaking by the person indemnified to employ
   counsel satisfactory to the Committee and to repay such payment if it shall ultimately be
   determined that he or she is not entitled to indemnification under this rule.

D. Further, that notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Rule, no indemnification
   shall be provided for any person with respect to any matter: (a) as to which he or she shall have
   been adjudicated in any proceeding not to have acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that
   his or her action was in the best interests of the Committee; or (b) disposed of by a compromise
   payment, pursuant to consent decree or otherwise, unless he or she shall have been
   determined to have acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that his or her action was in the
   best interest of the Committee, such determination to be made by a disinterested two-thirds
   (2/3) majority of all members of the Executive Board.

E. Further that the Committee may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any
   person who is or was a member of the Committee, a member of the Executive Board or an
   officer, employee, or other agent of the Committee, or who is or was serving at the request of
   the Committee as a member, director, trustee, officer, employee, fiduciary, or other agent of
   the corporation, trust, or other organization in which the committee has an interest, against
   any liability incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as
   such, whether or not the Committee would have the power to indemnify him or her against
   such liability.

F. This rule shall not limit any right of indemnification existing independently of this rule.

G. Definition: As used in this rule, the terms “member”, “director”, “trustee”, “officer”,
   “employee”, and “agent” shall include their respective heirs, executors, and administrators, and
   a “disinterested” person is one against whom the proceedings in question, or another
   proceeding of the same or similar grounds, are not then and had not been pending or
   threatened.
