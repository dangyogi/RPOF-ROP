RULE 7 - Alternate County Executive Committee Members
=====================================================

A. All county executive committees may include in their constitutions and/or bylaws a
   provision allowing alternate county committee members. The following is recommended for
   such use:

        There may be as many alternate county executive committee members as there are duly
        elected members in each precinct. Alternate members shall have no vote, except in the
        absence of the member they represent. Each alternate member shall possess the qualifications
        required of the members represented, shall file the same oath and shall be duly voted upon for
        membership by the members of the county committee.
