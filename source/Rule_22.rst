   Committee, Republican Club, Republican group, or group subject to the rules and regulations of
   the Republican Party of Florida, or between such parties, and such a dispute cannot be resolved
   by the members of said committee, club or group, then the resolution of the dispute may be
   referred in writing, by a member in good standing of the State or County Executive Committee,
   to the Executive Director of the Republican Party of Florida. The Executive Director shall refer

   resolved. If the Committee Chairman determines that a hearing is necessary, the Grievance
   Committee shall hold hearings with respect to the dispute, inviting all parties to the dispute or
   others, who may be of help to be heard, meet before the Grievance Committee. Other parties
   who may be of help to settle the dispute may also be given the opportunity to be heard. The
   Committee shall conduct the hearing in accordance with the Committeeâ€™s adopted rules of
   procedure. The notice of written grievance setting forth the conduct of the hearing shall be
   provided to the parties not less than 10 days in advance of the hearing.

D. Hearings will be held within (90) ninety days of such referral in Tallahassee, Florida, at

   hearing make a written report to the RPOF Chairman, setting forth its findings and
   recommendations as to settling the dispute.

E. If the Chairman of the RPOF approves the recommendations, they are adopted and
   become final. If the Chairman does not approve the recommendations, he may (a) refer the
   matter back to the Grievance Committee for further consideration or (b) refer the Committee
   recommendations to a Grievance Review Committee consisting of the Chairman of the RPOF,
   the Vice Chairman, RPOF, the Secretary, RPOF, Treasurer, RPOF, and the Legal Counsel to the
   Republican Party of Florida. The Review Committee shall make a final determination as to a
   course of action within (30) thirty days. Adoption by the RPOF Chairman as well as any final
   determination by the Review Committee shall be made in writing and provided to all parties
   concerned.

   of a Club Charter; removal or suspension of an officer or member of any authorized or
   chartered Club, Executive Committee or other committee from office or membership;
