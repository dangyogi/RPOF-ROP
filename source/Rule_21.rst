RULE 21 - Executive Committee and Executive Board Meetings
===========================================================

There shall be an annual meeting of the State RPOF Executive Committee held at such
time and place as the RPOF Executive Board may determine. Only members of the State RPOF
Executive Committee in good standing shall be eligible to vote at such meetings. Any challenges
as to the membership status of an individual must be made in writing to the Chairman of the
Credentials Committee so as to be received by that Chairman by 9:00 a.m. at least three (3)
working days prior to the date of the meeting to allow the Committee to investigate that
challenge.

Challenges not received in this timely manner shall not be heard except upon a two-
thirds (2/3) vote of the Credentials Committee. At this meeting in the odd number years, new
officers will be elected. Nominations for Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Secretary, Assistant
Secretary, Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer shall be made from the floor at the Annual
meeting in odd number years. In the event of more than one (1) nomination for any officer
position, the vote shall be conducted by secret paper ballot. No pre-printed ballot may be used
for this process. There shall be a minimum of four quarterly spaced meetings of the RPOF
Executive Board each year. The date, location and time will be proposed by the Chairman and
approved by the RPOF Board at the preceding quarterly Board meeting. With the exception of
the Annual Meeting, Executive Committee and Executive Board Meetings may be held by
electronic means with the consent of a majority of the Board, and in accordance with “Robert’s
Rules of Order, Newly Revised.”
